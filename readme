What is Toolbox?

 Toolbox is a compact, statically linked binary that combines many common command line utilities into a single executable. It is designed as a minimalist and efficient toolkit that provides essential Unix commands, all accessible through one binary, simplifying deployment and usage especially in resource constrained or embedded environments.

 Much like BusyBox and ToyBox, Toolbox offers streamlined replacements for many standard utilities you would typically find in GNU coreutils, util-linux, and other common Unix toolsets. While toolbox commands may not include every advanced feature of their full fledged GNU counterparts, they cover the core functionality expected by most users and scripts, ensuring familiar behavior and compatibility.



Why Toolbox?

 Single Binary Convenience: Instead of installing dozens of separate utilities, Toolbox bundles them into one executable. This reduces disk space usage, simplifies updates, and eases distribution.

 Static Linking: Toolbox is built as a statically linked binary, meaning it does not depend on external shared libraries at runtime. This makes it highly portable across different Linux distributions and environments without worrying about missing dependencies.

 Minimalist and Efficient: The commands are implemented with size and simplicity in mind, avoiding unnecessary complexity. This makes Toolbox ideal for embedded systems, containers, rescue environments, or minimal Linux setups where resources are limited.
 
Extensible Command Dispatch: Toolbox uses a clean and maintainable command dispatch mechanism, allowing easy addition of new commands without bloating the main program logic.

 Custom Utilities: Beyond standard Unix commands, Toolbox includes useful custom tools such as ascii2hex for converting ASCII strings to hexadecimal notation, enhancing its utility in scripting and debugging scenarios.



How to build?

 ./toolchain_build.sh
 make
 make install
 man toolbox



How It Works?

 Toolbox operates as a single statically linked executable that determines which command to run based on the first argument passed to it:

 ./toolbox ls /proc && echo $?

 ./toolbox cp /proc/cpuinfo /tmp && echo ?

 ./toolbox mkdir /tmp/test_dir && echo ?

 ./toolbox cat /proc/cpuinfo && echo $?

 ./toolbox echo "Hack the World" && echo $?

 /usr/bin/sleep 1024 & ps aux | grep "[s]leep 1024" | awk '{print $2}' | xargs -I{} ./toolbox kill 9 {}

 ./toolbox clear && echo $?

 ./toolbox rm /tmp/cpuinfo && echo $?

 /usr/bin/touch /tmp/file && ./toolbox rm /tmp/file && echo $?

 ./toolbox head toolbox.c && echo $?

 ./toolbox diff

 ./toolbox file toolbox && echo $?

 ./toolbox grep "grep" toolbox.c && echo $?

 ./toolbox rmdir /tmp/test_dir && echo $?

 ./toolbox ascii2hex

 ./toolbox sync && echo $?



Suported commands:

 ls - list directory contents

 cp - copy files

 mkdir  - create a directory

 cat - concatenate files and print on the stdout

 echo - print arguments

 kill - terminate a process

 clear - clear the terminal screen

 rm - remove files

 head - output the first part of a file

 diff - compare files line by line

 file - determine file type by the magic bytes signature

 grep - global regular expression print

 rmdir - remove directory

 sync - commit filesystem caches to disk

 ascii2hex - convert ASCII characters to their hexadecimal representation

 sync - commit filesystem caches to disk
