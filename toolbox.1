.SH NAME
toolbox \- a compact, statically linked binary combining many common *nix command line utilities
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B toolbox
[\fICOMMAND\fR] [\fIARGS\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Toolbox is a minimalist and efficient toolkit that provides essential *nix commands
through a single statically linked executable. It simplifies deployment and usage,
especially in resource constrained or embedded environments.

Much like BusyBox and ToyBox, Toolbox offers streamlined replacements for many standard
utilities found in GNU coreutils, util-linux, and other common *nix toolsets. While
toolbox commands may not include every advanced feature of their full fledged GNU
counterparts, they cover the core functionality expected by most users and scripts,
ensuring familiar behavior and compatibility.

.SH FEATURES
.IP "\fBSingle Binary Convenience:\fR"
Bundles many utilities into one executable, reducing disk space usage, simplifying updates,
and easing distribution.

.IP "\fBStatic Linking:\fR"
Built as a statically linked binary with no runtime dependencies on shared libraries,
ensuring portability across GNU/Linux distributions.

.IP "\fBMinimalist and Efficient:\fR"
Commands are designed for size and simplicity, ideal for embedded systems, containers,
rescue environments, or minimal GNU/Linux setups.

.IP "\fBExtensible Command Dispatch:\fR"
Uses a clean mechanism to dispatch commands, allowing easy addition of new commands
without bloating the main program.

.IP "\fBCustom Utilities:\fR"
Includes useful custom tools such as \fBascii2hex\fR for converting ASCII strings to
hexadecimal notation, enhancing scripting and debugging.

.SH USAGE
Toolbox determines which command to run based on the first argument:

.EX
 ./toolbox ls /proc
 ./toolbox cp /proc/cpuinfo /tmp/cpuinfo
 ./toolbox mkdir /tmp/testdir
 ./toolbox cat /proc/cpuinfo
 ./toolbox echo "Hack the World"
 ./toolbox clear
 ./toolbox rm /tmp/cpuinfo
 ./toolbox head toolbox.c 20
 ./toolbox file toolbox
 ./toolbox grep "main" toolbox.c
 ./toolbox rmdir /tmp/testdir
 ./toolbox ascii2hex
 ./toolbox sync
 ./toolbox true
 ./toolbox false
 ./toolbox tty
 ./toolbox kmsg
 ./toolbox shell
.EE
